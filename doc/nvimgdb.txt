Section 1: Usage                                                *NvimgdbUsage*

This plugin will facilitate debugging programs with GDB, LLDB or PDB. It will
automatically show debugged source code, breakpoints, and define convenient
keymaps similar to Qt Creator and Microsoft Visual Studio.

To start debugging, execute `:GdbStart` command with GDB launch string as
parameter: >

    :GdbStart gdb -q a.out

or alternatively `:GdbStartLLDB` with LLDB launch string as parameter: >

    :GdbStartLLDB lldb a.out

To debug Python programs, execute `:GdbStartPDB` and specify the python launch
command as parameter: >

    :GdbStartPDB python -m pdb main.py

This will open a new tab with debugging view: horizontal split with source
code and terminal. Then the whole set of commands will be available.

The plugin performs configuration on the first stop of the debugger. If you
launch by attaching to already running program, the first stop won't open the
source code location of the frame. To catch up, just navigate around the call
stack with `:GdbFrameUp` and `:GdbFrameDown`.

To quit debugging, either close one of the debugger windows or execute the
command `:GdbDebugStop`.

:GdbStartLLDB [cmd]     Start debugging session with the given LLDB launch
                        command.

:GdbEvalWord           Evaluate |<cword>| or |[range]|

==============================================================================
Section 3: Mappings                                          *NvimgdbMappings*

The following mappings are defined initially unless the global variable
g:nvimgdb_disable_start_keymaps is defined and evaluates to true:

<leader>dd             Fill in command to start debugging with GDB, you will
                       still need to enter <cr> to execute it.

<leader>dl             Fill in command to start debugging with LLDB, you will
                       still need to enter <cr> to execute it.

<leader>dp             Fill in command to start debugging with PDB, you will
                       still need to enter <cr> to execute it.

When debugging session has started, the following mappings are defined:

<f4>                   Until                          (`:GdbUntil`)
<f5>                   Continue                       (`:GdbContinue`)
<f10>                  Next                           (`:GdbNext`)
<f11>                  Step                           (`:GdbStep`)
<f12>                  Finish                         (`:GdbFinish`)
<f8>                   Toggle breakpoint              (`:GdbBreakpointToggle`)
<c-p>                  Frame Up                       (`:GdbFrameUp`)
<c-n>                  Frame Down                     (`:GdbFrameDown`)
<f9>                   NORMAL: Evaluate word under cursor (`:GdbEvalWord`)
                       VISUAL: Evaluate the range         (`:GdbEvalRange`)

==============================================================================
Section 4: Variables                                        *NvimgdbVariables*

If the variable g:nvimgdb_disable_start_keymaps is defined and evaluates to
true, the initial keymaps to start debugging session are suppressed
(see |NvimgdbMappings|).

The following variables could be defined to change default mappings for the
debugging commands: >

    g:nvimgdb_config
    g:nvimgdb_config_override
<
These variables are dictionaries with the keys described below. While the
first redefines the default configuration completely, the second one merely
allows overriding the given keys. For example, the default config is: >

    let g:nvimgdb_config = {
      \ 'key_until':      '<f4>',
      \ 'key_continue':   '<f5>',
      \ 'key_next':       '<f10>',
      \ 'key_step':       '<f11>',
      \ 'key_finish':     '<f12>',
      \ 'key_breakpoint': '<f8>',
      \ 'key_frameup':    '<c-p>',
      \ 'key_framedown':  '<c-n>',
      \ 'key_eval':       '<f9>',
      \ 'set_tkeymaps':   function('nvimgdb#keymaps#SetT'),
      \ 'set_keymaps':    function('nvimgdb#keymaps#Set'),
      \ 'unset_keymaps':  function('nvimgdb#keymaps#Unset'),
      \ }
<
The keys starting with `key_` define a key mapping for the respective command.
The key `set_tkeymaps` allows specifying a hook function, which will be called
when the terminal window has been created. You can call the default handler
from within the hook and/or define your own very specific terminal keymaps.
The keys `set_keymaps` and `unset_keymaps` are called every time when the
source code windows is entered and left. The first one can be used to define
source window-specific keymaps and the latter to carefully cleanup them.
See `test/init.vim` for an example.

Finally, every configuration key can be overridden with a global variable
prefixed `g:nvimgdb_`. For example, `g:nvimgdb_key_next` overrides
`g:nvimgdb_config["key_next"]` etc.

==============================================================================
Section 5: Limitations                                    *NvimgdbLimitations*

- The plugin is sensitive to the debugger settings. If prompt or frame format
  is changed, random errors may occur.

- LLDB uses the same frame format in multiple different situations. The
  command "thread backtrace", for instance, will cause jumps in the source
  code. Workaround: execute "frame info" in the debugger or
  `:GdbFrameUp` followed by `:GdbFrameDown`.

==============================================================================
Section 6: Development                                    *NvimgdbDevelopment*

- The keymaps are defined buffer-local for every buffer when it's entered,
  and undefined when a buffer is left. This was done to ensure that users's
  aren't overridden in long term. However, a more general solution could be
  to ensure the original keymaps are preserved and restored after debugging
  session: https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/7734/how-to-save-and-restore-a-mapping

- GDB is run via a proxy pty application, which allows to execute concealed
  service commands, like "info breakpoints" on each stop. Thus, the plugin
  is able to very carefully display current set of breakpoints with the
  temporal ones disappearing after hit. Technically, the proxy app is a python
  program that launches gdb in a pseudo terminal, listens a unix socket for
  commands, and processes the output of GDB to filter out service commands.

- LLDB is run in a wrapper that initializes the interpreter, and sources a
  python script. The script opens a unix domain socket and receives side
  commands from it in a background thread.

- PDB is like GDB run via a proxy application. Although, PDB doesn't have
  stock distinctive prefix to bypass the history. So an alias is created
  for that nvim-gdb-info-breakpoints.

- Breakpoints are queried from GDB, LLDB and PDB on every pause using the
  established side channels: the pty proxy for GDB and PDB, and Python script
  running inside the LLDB. The communication is done via unix domain sockets
  (see lib/info_breakpoints.py).
